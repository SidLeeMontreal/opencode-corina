# AGENTS.md — Corina Writing Agent

## System Overview

Corina is available both as an OpenCode plugin and as a hosted OpenCode Server container.

Distributed as an npm package (`opencode-corina`) and as a local plugin via `.opencode/plugins/corina.ts`.

## Runtime Surfaces

| Surface | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **OpenCode plugin** | Repo root — `src/`, `.opencode/plugins/`, `.opencode/tools/`, `.opencode/agents/` | Local development: tools, agents, and the editorial pipeline run inside your OpenCode session |
| **Hosted OpenCode Server container** | `deploy/openwork-server/` | Containerized server exposing `/v1/models` and `/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compatible API) for hosted/remote consumers |

The plugin entrypoint (`src/index.ts`) does **not** serve the `/v1` API surface. The OpenAI-compatible endpoints are provided exclusively by the hosted container in `deploy/openwork-server/`.

Orchestration model (plugin surface):

```
User
→ Corina (primary agent — conversational orchestrator)
→ .opencode/tools/ (standalone callable tools)
→ src/ execution layer (TypeScript, opencode-corina npm)
→ .opencode/agents/ subagents (spawned via Task tool)
```

## Agent Roster

Primary
- `corina` — Front-facing writer and orchestrator.

Critique / Audit
- `prose-evaluator` — Prose-quality evaluator.
- `voice-evaluator` — Voice-alignment evaluator.
- `evidence-evaluator` — Evidence-integrity evaluator.
- `format-auditor` — Deterministic formatting evaluator.
- `critic-adjudicator` — Final critique aggregator.
- `auditor-adjudicator` — Final audit aggregator.

Detection
- `detector` — LLM-based AI detection judge. Used by `detect`.

Tone
- `tone-writer` — Applies voice.
- `tone-validator` — Validates tone rewrite quality.

Concision
- `concise-auditor` — Pass A orchestrator.
- `concise-reviser` — Pass B reviser.
- `concise-stitcher` — Pass C stitcher.
- `concise-reconciler` — Pass D reconciler.

Rule
- All subagents are hidden (not in @autocomplete) and callable only via the Task tool.


## Tool Roster

- `draft` — `.opencode/tools/draft.ts` — Full 5-step gated editorial pipeline with structured public envelope
- `tone` — `.opencode/tools/tone.ts` — Voice/tone rewriter with 11 voices
- `detect` — `.opencode/tools/detect.ts` — AI-pattern detector with Layer 1 and Layer 2 analysis
- `critique` — `.opencode/tools/critique.ts` — Quality, audience, rubric, and compare modes
- `concise` — `.opencode/tools/concise.ts` — Reduces fluff while preserving substance; supports quick and full modes

Tools are standalone files. They load independently of the plugin.
The plugin (`src/index.ts`) observes all tool calls via `tool.execute.after` for logging and audit.

## Plugin Role (`src/index.ts`)

The plugin is observability infrastructure only. It does **not** implement tools.

Responsibilities:
- `server.connected` → log `plugin_loaded`
- `tool.execute.after` → log `tool_complete`, write capability audit entry for `draft`/`tone`/`detect`/`critique` tools
- `session.idle` → write `session_idle` audit entry
- Future: `tool.execute.before` for guardrails and quota enforcement

## Local dev setup

`npm install` runs `preinstall` (`scripts/ensure-opencode-deps.mjs`), which clones `opencode-model-resolver`, `opencode-text-tools`, and `opencode-eval-harness` into `deps/` and builds them so `file:deps/…` resolves. **Git** must be available. To skip cloning (you already maintain `deps/`): `SKIP_OPENCODE_DEPS=1`. For OpenCode’s `.opencode/` tooling, run `npm install` from the repo root first so those paths exist. Details: `README.md` (local plugin section).

## Prompt Governance

All prompts live in `prompts/` (versioned in repo):
- `prompts/base/` — core persona and system behavior
- `prompts/tasks/` — task-specific instructions
- `prompts/voices/` — 11 voice profiles

Overrides: `.corina-local/prompts/` (gitignored, not committed)
Loader: `src/prompt-loader.ts` (checks override dir first, falls back to bundled)

**Never hardcode prompt text in TypeScript source files.**

## Orchestration Rules

1. Corina does not write content directly — she always calls a tool.
2. For authoring requests, Corina routes through `draft`.
3. In public tool responses, `artifact` is canonical, `rendered` is presentation, `outcome` is authoritative, and `should_persist` governs persistence.
4. Tools execute synchronously today — async job support is planned for OpenWork integration.
5. Chain calls (`--chain`) are handled inside the tool execution layer.
6. Subagents are spawned per-session; they do not share state.
7. `corina.md` declares `permission.task` to control which subagents can be invoked.

## Subagent Invocation (Task tool)

Corina can spawn subagents via the built-in `Task` tool. `permission.task` in `corina.md`
controls which subagents are accessible. Subagent names map to `.opencode/agents/*.md` filenames.

Current allowed subagents: prose-evaluator, voice-evaluator, evidence-evaluator, format-auditor, critic-adjudicator, auditor-adjudicator, detector, tone-writer, tone-validator, concise-auditor, concise-reviser, concise-stitcher, concise-reconciler

To add a new invocable subagent:
1. Create `.opencode/agents/your-agent.md` with `mode: subagent` and `hidden: true`
2. Add it to the `permission.task` allowlist in `corina.md`
3. Document it in the Agent Roster table above

## Never-Fail Rule

Every tool must return output for every valid input.
- Never ask clarifying questions when input is complete.
- Infer missing parameters from context.
- Degrade gracefully with a note — never silently fail or return empty output.

## Adding a New Capability

1. Write the TypeScript execution layer: `src/your-capability.ts`
2. Create the standalone tool file: `.opencode/tools/your-tool-name.ts`
3. Create agent `.md` files if new subagents are needed: `.opencode/agents/`
4. Add prompts: `prompts/tasks/` or `prompts/voices/`
5. Write Tier 1 eval cases: `evals/suites/`
6. Run: `npm run build && npm run test:unit && npm run eval:tier1`
7. Update this file: agent roster, tool roster

## Future: OpenWork Integration

When async job execution is added:
- `draft`, `tone`, `detect`, `critique`, `concise` tools gain `submit_*_job` / `get_*_job_status` variants
- Tools return a job receipt immediately; result is fetched when ready
- Plugin gains a `job.status.updated` event handler to surface results
- Standalone tool files make this swap possible without touching the plugin

## Eval Coverage

| Suite | Command | Count | When to run |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit tests | `npm run test:unit` | 55 | Every commit |
| Tier 1 eval | `npm run eval:tier1` | 22 | Every commit |
| Integration | `npm run test:integration` | 16 | Before releases |
| Tier 2 eval | `npm run eval:tier2` | — | Before releases (slow) |
